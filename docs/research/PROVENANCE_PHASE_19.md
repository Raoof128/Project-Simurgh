# Phase 19: authority provenance

Declared 1 November 2026 (Australia/Sydney), baseline `30fe9e4b`, under the owner's instruction to
proceed with the gauntlet-revised design
([Phase 19 v2.1](../superpowers/specs/2026-11-01-phase-19-authority-provenance-design.md)).
Phase 19a, 19b and 19c are executed here; 19d–19g are declared scope and are not implemented by
this entry.

## Design and scope

The 1 November gap hunt ranked fifteen gaps from 230 lab pages; the design answers them with an
agent-writable manifest, provenance-tagged decision records, a belief-sensitivity receipt and one
lane per gap. Phase 19a is the only sub-phase with no new runtime mechanism: a verifier and a pack
that recompute four projections from the frozen Phase 17 archive (declines/blocks/admits per
generation and control; an awareness-flag sidecar that is not evaluable on this archive; coverage as
three counts with an architectural denominator; a judge-free row and the forced-call citation).
Results: [provenance-phase-19a/RESULTS.md](provenance-phase-19a/RESULTS.md).

Phase 19b-1 ([plan](../superpowers/plans/2026-11-01-phase-19b-write-anywhere-lane.md)) adds, over
the unpinned successor pipeline, the Agent-Writable Manifest with a reader census, the write-anywhere
differential lane with nine reader mutants as positive controls, signed provenance-tagged decision
records with an offline verifier, the signal-outage hold and acknowledgement-bound lease renewal,
and a Lean transition-system model with a differential test against the running gate. 19b-2 adds
the host-issued approval token with a seven-way forged-token matrix, the re-implemented dispatch
that admits a token-approved ungranted action under the frozen budget, fact and duplicate rules,
and the `tool_result_body` reader as the fourth wired channel, which closes 19b (`closed_by` in the
receipt).
Results: [provenance-phase-19b/RESULTS.md](provenance-phase-19b/RESULTS.md).

Phase 19c ([plan](../superpowers/plans/2026-11-01-phase-19c-forked-receiver.md)) forks the frozen
receiver inside the namespace and adds eight reasons after the six frozen ones: run-bound credentials,
holder-bound sessions, an approved-input manifest (`substituted_input`, G28), a canonicalising
receiver with two effect classes for the route corpus, per-call and running limits, administrative
revocation and grant scope. Every lane is receiver-direct and drives the frozen receiver on the same
bytes. Results: [provenance-phase-19c/RESULTS.md](provenance-phase-19c/RESULTS.md).

Trusted host, provisioning, storage and receiver, as in the README. The frozen modules are neither
edited nor imported except for the optional Linux replay chain. Recomputing the project's own
archive is not custody evidence.

## Write scope and gate lifecycle

Add `tools/assurance-provenance/**`, `docs/research/provenance-phase-19a/**`,
`docs/research/provenance-phase-19b/**`, `docs/research/provenance-phase-19c/**`, `proofs/phase19/**`, this ledger and the
Phase 19 design, plan, plug-in map and gauntlet records under `docs/superpowers/`. Modify
`.prettierignore` (P19-FORMAT01, 02 and 03: evidence files, bytes preserved), `AGENT.md`,
`CHANGELOG.md`, and `scripts/check-lean-proofs.mjs` (floor 39→40, in the commit that adds the proof).
Modify nothing frozen. The CI workflow `.github/workflows/assurance-provenance.yml` is added under P19-CI01 in one commit
with the Stage 5Q census re-pin, after this declaration.

**P19-CI01 (exercised 1 Nov 2026).** When the workflow is added, that single commit may modify
only `current` in `docs/research/llm-shield/evidence/stage-5q-q1/problem-gate-set.json` for the exact
new CI identities measured by `measureGateCensus.mjs` against the draft workflow (Phase 9 added one
identity for its step; the count here is measured, not assumed), and must carry a `paths:` filter on
`tools/assurance-provenance/**` and `docs/research/provenance-phase-19a/**`. This declaration must be
a strict ancestor of that commit. Preserve all non-current fields.

**P19-LEAN01 (authority for one Stage 5S test edit).** `tests/unit/llmShield/stage5s/theoremSet.test.js`
test `[5s-t26]` pins the repository Lean floor at exactly 39 and the gate's discovered count at exactly 39. Adding any proof, which `scripts/check-lean-proofs.mjs` itself instructs the adding task to do by
raising the floor, breaks it. That is a count pin of the Q1-F002 species named in
`docs/research/llm-shield/references/gate-lifecycle.md` (pin sets, not counts). This declaration
authorises changing those two assertions to monotone bounds (floor at least 39; discovered count at
least the floor; the gate must still report zero escape hatches and all type-check) and nothing else in
that file. This declaration commit must be a strict ancestor of that edit.

## Execution ledger

- Ruling: design approved only after a four-review gauntlet; v1 failed (41 findings), v2.1 holds with
  0 P0/P1 open in text. 19a approved outright by the closure reviewer; 19b/19c text fixed after that
  review and not independently re-read.
- Ruling: the pack was produced on macOS without the frozen replay chain, after the lane sources
  were committed; `receipt.json` records the host outcome and the commit in `tree_state`. A Linux
  run with `--replay` is owed before any "replayed" wording.
- Tests: 18 passed for 19a; 57 passed for the namespace after 19b-1 (`tools/assurance-provenance/tests`),
  ruff clean, Lean proof gate 40/40. No hosted CI receipt yet.
- Ruling: the 19a protocol pinned the lane directory by glob; adding the 19b-1 modules invalidated
  the committed 19a pack (`protocol_inventory`). The pin is now an explicit file set (pin sets, not
  counts) and the 19a pack was regenerated from the lane commit that carries the fix.
- Ruling: 19b-1 ended with three wired deterministic channels; 19b-2 wired the fourth and the
  receipt now reads `phase_19b_closed: true` on six named conditions. Not among them: the native
  delivery path (not exercised on this host) and any outside replay.
- Ruling: the workflow's five run steps are the gate ids the census measured; `current` gained
  exactly those, `baseline` untouched. The workflow installs elan so the Lean differential test runs
  rather than skips, and chains the frozen Phase 17 replay through the 19a verifier on Linux x86_64,
  which the authoring host could not. No hosted run has executed yet; the first run's receipt is owed.
- Ruling: 19c is receiver-direct by design (gauntlet M5). The strawman is a power check and G22 is
  not paid. A POSIX leading double slash is not a receiver's canonical form; the canonicaliser
  collapses it.
- Ruling: an invalid relayed approval never reduces authority. It is recorded with its reason and
  the ordinary grant path decides; otherwise the tool-result channel would be a denial lever.
