- **Files Changed:**
  - `README.md` - Entirely rewritten with the new Simurgh brand, dropping "Verity", updating architectural descriptions, and refining the strategic roadmap.
- **Verification:** Readme markdown is properly formatted with the appropriate links, headers, code block architectures, and images preserved.
- **Follow-ups:** Ensure that any other text occurrences or components inside the source code (like public HTML files) are eventually scrubbed of "Verity" if necessary.
